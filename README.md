Maharashtra is a key contributor to India's agricultural sector, with its productivity heavily influenced by climatic and environmental factors. This study examines the relationship between crop yield, production, and critical variables such as temperature, rainfall, irrigation, and nutrient consumption using data from 1966 to 2023. Correlations between yield, production, and factors like weather, fertilizers, and soil nutrients are analyzed. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) identifies the most influential factors, while the Apriori algorithm uncovers associations between agricultural attributes. For forecasting, machine learning models—RFR (Random Forest Regressor), SVR (Support Vector Regressor), and GBR (Gradient Boosting Regressor)—are compared, with GBR emerging as the best. STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess) is applied to GBR's time series data to reveal trends and seasonal patterns. This comprehensive approach provides actionable insights for enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability in Maharashtra.
